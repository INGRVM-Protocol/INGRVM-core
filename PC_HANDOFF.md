### **Resume Project THOR / Synapse: Global Mesh & GPU Training**

We've achieved a massive breakthrough: **Physical LAN Connectivity Verified**. The PC and Laptop are communicating flawlessly over raw TCP (Port 60005) and the high-reliability File Mesh fallback.

**Current State:**
- The physical network path is open and firewalls are configured.
- We've identified that the `py-libp2p` security handshake is the final bottleneck on Windows.
- We've built **35+ logical modules** covering everything from Brain logic to Voice integration, DAO governance, and WAN readiness.
- The project is **100% logic-complete** for the Virtual Seed phase.
- The project journal is `THOR_Synapse_Project_Journal.md`.

**Tasks for this session:**

1. **Docker Deployment:**
   - On the PC, let's build the **Synapse Spore** image using the `Dockerfile`.
   - Run the node inside a container. This will use the Linux network stack and should solve the security handshake once and for all.
   
2. **GPU Training (The Muscle):**
   - Unleash the **1080 Ti**. Run the `train_synapse_0.py` script with the mock data we generated.
   - Verify that the SNN weights are saved and can be "packed" into a `.synapse` bundle.

3. **Multi-Node Verification:**
   - Once the PC is running in Docker, run the `spike_sender.py` on the Laptop.
   - We want to see the Laptop's spikes processed by the **Containerized PC Brain** without using fallbacks.

4. **Closing Protocol:**
   - Update the `THOR_Synapse_Project_Journal.md` with the results.
   - Regenerate this handoff prompt for Phase 6.
